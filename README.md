# Description
Investigating Useful Individual Personalities from Users’ Responses to Art Pieces. /
Built random forest and logistic regression models to predict users' political orientation based on other relevant variables in datasets.
Formulated hypotheses concerning users' personalities such as differences in preference ratings based on art background and modern vs. non-human art preferences and tested these hypotheses by statistical tests like one-tailed Mann-Whitney U.
Developed multi-variate regression models for art rating prediction with k-fold cross-validation and employed K-means clustering to uncover potential clusters in the 2D space of users' preference ratings and personalities.
Applied PCA to users' personalities and decided on the optimal number of principal components to predict users’ preference ratings
